								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>What is my interest in IT and when did my interest in IT start?</p>
								<p>In IT, I like to see people do their programming and especially in web development. My interest about IT started just last year, when I was in grade 12 and I have no idea about what I am going to learn and to be in the future then one night when I was watching Youtube, i saw a Youtube video with the title ”Cool text animation using HTML” I clicked on that and saw a person typing some kind code line and then the person run the code a website pop up with a lot of cool effect and at the time I think that i’m going to study IT.</p>
								<p>Why did i choose to come to RMIT?</p>
								<p>So there are 2 reasons of why I chose RMIT. The first reason is the school’s facilities, I’ve done a campus tour in several universities and I have to say that none of them are better than RMIT. And the second reason is other universities in Vietnam they teach philosophy and I don’t like that subject.</p>
								<p>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</p>
								<p>Apart from the knowledge that I will get during my studies, I’m also looking forward to achieve some soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem solving, work ethic and the Ability to Work Under Pressure and Time Management.</p>

								<p> Here are the snapshots of the test that i took: <a href="https://github.com/nhatquan0312/normal_kid/blob/master/images/Myers%20Briggs.png">Myers-Briggs test</a> <a href="https://github.com/nhatquan0312/normal_kid/blob/master/images/Learning%20Style%20Test.png">Learning Style test</a> <a href="https://github.com/nhatquan0312/normal_kid/blob/master/images/big%20five%20personality%20test.png"> Big Five Personalities test </a> 
								<p>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</p>
								<p>-For me, these tests are accurate when it described my personality and my lifestyle. Through the test I was able to know what are my strengths and weeknesses and from that I can emphasize on my good sides and overcome my bad one. For example, in the Myers-Briggs test, the test indicates that I am a creative person and this is important because in some group assignments or work in the future we need to present and doing our projects which need ideas and this is where creativity shows up to work, and my down side is I’m a bit too much of a perfectionistic, I always wanted my work to be as perfect as possible but in the reality, things may not go like the way you want it to go and the result is I easily got burnt out and I have to overcome that.</p>	
								<p>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</p>	
								<p>-In my opinion, I don’t these results will inflence my behaviour a lot when i am in a team although it described me accurately. Because when in a team, when we are doing our project, there will always be some aurguments between the team members when things don’t go the way that each person want and the solution to this is each team member will be given the part of the project that suits their personality the most and after we done we could discuss if there is something wrong so that we could fix it.</p>	
								<p>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </p>	
								<p>-When forming a team, I want to choose my team member who has the opposite personality of me, specifically the one who has my weeknesses as their strengths and my strengths as their weeknesses so while doing the project we can somehow support each other and throughout the work we can learn something from our team member to overcome our weeknesses.</p>
