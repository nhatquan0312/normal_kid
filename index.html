								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p>What is my interest in IT and when did my interest in IT start?</p>
								<p>In IT, I like to see people do their programming and especially in web development. My interest about IT started just last year, when I was in grade 12 and I have no idea about what I am going to learn and to be in the future then one night when I was watching Youtube, i saw a Youtube video with the title ”Cool text animation using HTML” I clicked on that and saw a person typing some kind code line and then the person run the code a website pop up with a lot of cool effect and at the time I think that i’m going to study IT.</p>
								<p>Why did i choose to come to RMIT?</p>
								<p>So there are 2 reasons of why I chose RMIT. The first reason is the school’s facilities, I’ve done a campus tour in several universities and I have to say that none of them are better than RMIT. And the second reason is other universities in Vietnam they teach philosophy and I don’t like that subject.</p>
								<p>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</p>
								<p>Apart from the knowledge that I will get during my studies, I’m also looking forward to achieve some soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem solving, work ethic and the Ability to Work Under Pressure and Time Management.</p>
