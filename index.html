								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<b>What is my interest in IT and when did my interest in IT start?</b>
								<p>In IT, I like to see people do their programming and especially in web development. My interest about IT started just last year, when I was in grade 12 and I have no idea about what I am going to learn and to be in the future then one night when I was watching Youtube, i saw a Youtube video with the title ”Cool text animation using HTML” I clicked on that and saw a person typing some kind code line and then the person run the code a website pop up with a lot of cool effect and at the time I think that i’m going to study IT.</p>
								<b>Why did i choose to come to RMIT?</b>
								<p>So there are 2 reasons of why I chose RMIT. The first reason is the school’s facilities, I’ve done a campus tour in several universities and I have to say that none of them are better than RMIT. And the second reason is other universities in Vietnam they teach philosophy and I don’t like that subject.</p>
								<b>What do I expect to learn during my studies?</b>
								<p>Apart from the knowledge that I will get during my studies, I’m also looking forward to achieve some soft skills such as teamwork, communication, problem solving, work ethic and the Ability to Work Under Pressure and Time Management.</p>

								<p> Here are the snapshots of the test that i took: <a href="https://github.com/nhatquan0312/normal_kid/blob/master/images/Myers%20Briggs.png">Myers-Briggs test</a> <a href="https://github.com/nhatquan0312/normal_kid/blob/master/images/Learning%20Style%20Test.png">Learning Style test</a> <a href="https://github.com/nhatquan0312/normal_kid/blob/master/images/big%20five%20personality%20test.png"> Big Five Personalities test </a> 
								<b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b>
								<p>-For me, these tests are accurate when it described my personality and my lifestyle. Through the test I was able to know what are my strengths and weeknesses and from that I can emphasize on my good sides and overcome my bad one. For example, in the Myers-Briggs test, the test indicates that I am a creative person and this is important because in some group assignments or work in the future we need to present and doing our projects which need ideas and this is where creativity shows up to work, and my down side is I’m a bit too much of a perfectionistic, I always wanted my work to be as perfect as possible but in the reality, things may not go like the way you want it to go and the result is I easily got burnt out and I have to overcome that.</p>	
								<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>	
								<p>-In my opinion, I don’t these results will inflence my behaviour a lot when i am in a team although it described me accurately. Because when in a team, when we are doing our project, there will always be some aurguments between the team members when things don’t go the way that each person want and the solution to this is each team member will be given the part of the project that suits their personality the most and after we done we could discuss if there is something wrong so that we could fix it.</p>	
								<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </b>	
								<p>-When forming a team, I want to choose my team member who has the opposite personality of me, specifically the one who has my weeknesses as their strengths and my strengths as their weeknesses so while doing the project we can somehow support each other and throughout the work we can learn something from our team member to overcome our weeknesses.</p>

							    <h2 class="major">Project Ideas</h2>
								
								  <b>Overview</b>
									<p>-So my project idea is to create a social audio platform (I haven’t think of the name yet) that let the music creator to create and upload their sound privately or publicly to their friends, families or everywhere in the social networks. The website is not just for the creator it also for the audience the listener who wants to find new music to hear, user can save their favorite tracks and playlists and the related genre recommendations will help the user discovers more.</p>
									<b>Motivation</b>
									<p>-The reason why I think this project is going to be interesting or useful is because of how impactful and importance music is to our everyday life. First, music is everybody’s language, while in the world people communicate through different languages but when a music festival shows up and people from many countries come join over, the music is played it seems that everybody understand what is coming out from the speaker and everybody starts to dancing to it. Second reason is from my own experience, everytime that I study or basically just relax, I usually listen to some instrumental music and it helps me to focus on studying.</p>
									<b>Description</b>
									<p>So there are a tons of features that I want to implement in this platform, including:</p>
									<p>-Listen to the audio online on the website.</p>
									<p>-Join an audio platform where you can upload your own music and give a link to purchase it or just let the listeners download them offline.</p>
									<p>-Listeners can add comments to the part of the song that they are listenning.</p>
									<p>-Create your favorite song playlists for different purposes.</p>
									<p>-Based on the music or the genre that you usually hear, the website will recommmends songs with the same genre to you, for example if the user like jazz then we will find songs that has that genre for the user.</p>
									<p>-We also going to create mutiple playlists for many purposes and times in a day, for example a playlist to start off your day, before going to bed, boost up your productivity or playlist while you are playing games, going to the gym, finding motivation and so on.</p>
									<p>-A built-in Equalizer for you to adjust the bass, treble, mid or anything else of the song. </p>
									<p>-An IOS or Android app to keep your music played on the go without have to bring your whole laptop with you just needwant t a smartphone or tablet with the app sync with the website using your account and you good to go. </p>
									<p>-A recorder that is built in the app so when there’s a song that you hear outside the street or anywhere that you like but don’t know the name of the song you can use this recorder to catch the audio and the system will automatically return the result as the name of the song you heard.</p>
									<p>-A software that is built in the website for the creator to create and edit their songs with guide on how to use them and this is a special feature of the website and only pro member can use it and to be a pro member users have to pay a monthly fee in order to have this.</p>
									<p>-A feature that will inform you when your favorite singer or band is going to perform you’re your area and it’s a bad experience when you miss the performance of your favorite singer or band.</p>
									<p>-A month free of using the Pro Member feature including a built-in software for editing sound and ad-free, after a month we will let the user decides if they want to continue on being a ProMember or not.</p>
									<b>Tool and technologies</b>
									<p>-So what you need in order to build this website obviously is a computer and wifi. Secondly is that you will need to have an app builder to build a mobile version of the website. We also need to have some kind of cloud storage to store audio files from the users securely since the data is estimated to be very huge. The last one which is the hardest to get is to have an internet hosting server in order for the website to work properly and accessible through the World Wide Web and why i said this is the hardest to get is because we need money for this service.</p>
									<b>Skills required</b>
									<p>-So there are some skills that we need to build this project. First is programming, to build a website you need to know how to use HTML to build documents on the website, CSS a language that is go along with HTML to set the style of the webpage, this will include the font the backgroung color or bascically anything that is related to design, and we also need JavaScript for the animation and the interactivity on the website. And about the mobile version we need to have some knowledge about Python or Java.</p>
									<b>Outcome </b>
									<p>-To be honest, I haven’t think of this situation yet. I guess if the project is successful, for the good outcome, maybe someone will notice and use this then give some feedback about the website so that we can develop more in the future and worst outcome that could happen to our website is that it will crash for no reasons and we will have a hard time trying to find the solution. About how impactful this development will have I think it won’t catch everybody’s attention because there are so many good audio platforms out there such as SoundCloud, Spotify or Zing MP3.</p>
